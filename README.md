# Serverless Guru Challenge | AWS API Gateway CRUD REST API

This repository has been set up as a REST API Endpoint that can be called by consumer lambdas to create, read, update and delete notes.

The requirements for the developed functions can be found in this [code challenge](https://github.com/serverless-guru/code-challenges/tree/master/code-challenge-5).

## Features

The developed /create endpoint will create a new note and save it into the Note DynamoDB Table.

The `/update/{id}` endpoint will update an existing note based on the ID provided.

The `/read/{id}` endpoint will fetch existing notes based on the ID provided.

The `/delete/{id}` endpoint will delete an existing note based on the ID provided.

The `/readAll` endpoint will fetch all the notes saved in the table.

## Dependencies

The current developed code does not have any external dependencies.
 Internal dependencies are:

- Node version: `>=14.15.1`
- NPM version: `>=6.10.0`

The APIs are publicly accessible without VPC constraints, or any other form of authentications.

## Getting started
